# jogl-samples

The Java OpenGL Samples Pack (called unsurprisingly jogl-samples) is a port of the [OpenGL Samples Pack](http://www.g-truc.net/project-0026.html), a collection of [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) samples based on the OpenGL "core profile" specifications.

The project aims to promote the new OpenGL features making easier version transitions for OpenGL programmers with a complementary documentation for the OpenGL specification. Despite the fact that the OpenGL Samples Pack provides as simple (and dumb) as possible samples, it's not a tutorial for beginner but a project for programmers already familiar with OpenGL. The OpenGL Samples Pack is also a good OpenGL drivers feature test.

These samples use [NEWT](http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/NEWT-Overview.html) to create window and [jogl](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) of [Jogamp](http://jogamp.org/) as OpenGL wrapper, [jglm](https://github.com/elect86/Jglm) as math library and to replace OpenGL fixed pipeline functions and [jgli](https://github.com/elect86/jgli) to load images. 

Samples divided per profiles:

* es-200
* es-300
* gl-300
* gl-320
* gl-330
* gl-400
* gl-410
* gl-420
* gl-430
* gl-440
* gl-450
* gl-500


Ps: Hello Triangle and Hello Texture were moved into a stand-alone [project](https://github.com/elect86/helloTriangle)
